## Contributing Guidelines

Are you identified with the project theme and you want to contribute with something? ? Here's how you can help.

### Bugs reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest main or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.

4. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include specific information about the environment - operating system and version, browser and version... and steps required to reproduce the issue.

### Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

1. Push your changes to GitHub by running: git push origin my-feature-branch

2. [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/gsmainclusivetechlab/token-backend/pulls) with a clear title and description with your changes.
