The Tokenaisation asset has two different simulation environments to allow you to test the asset:

1. **On-line Simulation:** uses the web browser and a mobile phone virtual simulation to demonstrate all the potentials of tokenisation.
2. **Live Simulation:** users can user they own phone to send messages and simulate different scenarios. The agents/merchants interface is still web based.

Both environments can be accessed by the page Try Token, available here: https://token.gsmainclusivetechlab.io/trytoken

:::note User Data
The online version uses only random data. The live version reuires the user phone to exchange text messages. The data used is kept only during the testing process. After that all the simulation data is deleted.

The picture below shows the web interface to access both environments. In the next sections it is possible to read details about the interface and commands to test the environments.
